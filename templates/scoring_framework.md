# Technical Due Diligence – Scoring Framework

This framework scores a company’s technical health across six dimensions on a 0–5 maturity scale.  
Scores must be backed by evidence, not intuition alone.

---

## Maturity Scale (0–5)

- **0 – Non-existent**  
  No process, practice, or capability in place.

- **1 – Ad hoc**  
  Inconsistent, depends on individuals, little or no documentation.

- **2 – Emerging**  
  Some patterns or tools in place; partially documented; gaps are common.

- **3 – Defined & Repeatable**  
  Documented processes; generally followed; results are predictable.

- **4 – Measured & Optimized**  
  Metrics and feedback loops exist; continuous improvement is visible.

- **5 – Best-in-Class**  
  Exemplary for the company’s stage and domain; a reference model for others.

2. Security & Risk
